# odbr package

## Objective

<br> 

A Package that makes available data from Brazil's orgin-destination (OD) surveys

<br> 

[GitHub repository](https://github.com/hsvab/odbr)



## Motivation

<br>

- My master's thesis: [Mobility pattern trends in the metropolitan area of SÃ£o Paulo: the need of a gender perspective](https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/3/3138/tde-30092016-142308/pt-br.php)

- 1977, 1987, 1997 and 2007 cohorts from SÃ£o Paulo


- Wish to maximize the impact of my research and its results


- GitHub repositories: [databases](https://github.com/hsvab/mestrado-usp-ODs) and [algorithms](https://github.com/hsvab/mestrado-usp-algoritmos)



## First Steps

<br>

- Similar packages?


## First Steps

<br>

- Similar packages? [od](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/od/vignettes/od.html)


## First Steps

<br>

- Similar packages? [od](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/od/vignettes/od.html)

- It is not a data package

- Functions for analysing OD surveys

## First Steps

<br>

- Inspirational packages?

## First Steps

<br>

- Inspirational packages? [geobr](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/)

## First Steps

<br>

- Inspirational packages? [geobr](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/)

- It is a data package

- It is from Brazil

## First Steps

<br>

- Inspirational packages? [geobr](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/)

- It is a data package

- It is from Brazil

- Talk to Rafael Pereira (May 11th)

## First Steps

<br>

- Inspirational packages? [geobr](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/)

- It is a data package

- It is from Brazil

- Talk to Rafael Pereira (May 11th): what is his opinion about creating new monetary variables (such as family income) with all nominal values brought to the same date

## Strategic questions

<br>

- Will it be data only for SÃ£o Paulo or for all of Brazil?

- Will it be only the databases in their original format? Or will there be some harmonization (between locations and/or years)?

## Strategic questions

<br>

- Will it be data only for SÃ£o Paulo or for all of Brazil?

The package will seek OD survey data from all Brazilian cities with this type of data, but this year, within the rOpenSci program, I will focus only on data from SÃ£o Paulo.


- Will it be only the databases in their original format? Or will there be some harmonization (between locations and/or years)?

I will make the databases available in their original format and with some harmonization between the years, for the same place.


## Other valuable tips from the talk

- failures and challenges that the geobr package faced, such as how to make large databases available: [piggyback](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/piggyback/index.html)

- gave another, simpler package to also have as reference: [aopdata](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aopdata/index.html)


## Main functions

<br>

- download_piggyback() 

- read_od()

- read_dictionary()


## Main functions

<br>

### download_piggyback()

- **required parameter**: the filename_to_download

- **description**: download data from an existing release, used by read_od() and read_dictionary() functions

- **return**: temporary_filename with the downloaded data

- **status**: done!


## Main functions

<br>

### read_od()

- **required parameter**: city, year and whether you want the harmonised database (over the years, for the same city) or not - the default is the raw base

- **description**: after some argument checking it calls download_piggyback()

- **return**: od_file with the requested data (if exists)

- **status**: structure is done, need to improve the composition of the path with filename


## Main functions

<br>

### read_dictionary()

- **required parameter**: city, year and whether you want the harmonized database (over the years, for the same city) or not - the default is the raw base

- **description**: after some argument checking it calls download_piggyback()

- **return**: to be defined

- **status**: to do


## Next steps raodmap

- **June/2023**: Make available 1977 dataset (raw) within a data dictionary (v.0.0.2) + rOpenSci Meeting

- **July/2023**: Make available 1987, 1977, 2007 and 2017 dataset (raw) within a data dictionary for each (v.0.0.3)
- **August/2023**: Make available 1977, 1987, 1977, 2007 and 2017 dataset (harmonized)(v.0.0.4)
- **September/2023**: Make available 1977, 1987, 1977, 2007 and 2017 dictionaries (harmonized)(v.1.0.0 - pre relase) + rOpenSci Meeting
- **October/2023**: Final reviews after feedbacks (v.1.0.0 - production)
- **November/2023**: Docuemtnation + create a website for the package with pkgdown
